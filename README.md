In this project, we designed a secure video streaming service inspired by cybersecurity practices from companies like Netflix and Amazon. The focus was on developing a robust web application that protects against common security vulnerabilities. Here's a summary of the key components and steps involved in the project:

Project Components:
Web Application Framework:

The backend is built using Node.js with the Express framework to handle server-side logic.
React is used for the frontend to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
Database:

PostgreSQL is chosen for data storage, particularly for managing user credentials and video content metadata.
User Authentication:

Implemented JWT-based authentication to ensure secure access controls.
Passwords are securely hashed using bcryptjs before storing them in the database to enhance security.
Security Measures:

The application includes measures to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks by validating and sanitizing inputs.
HTTPS is configured to secure data transmission between the client and server.
Tools like OWASP ZAP are recommended for vulnerability scanning to identify and mitigate security threats.
Development Practices:

The project emphasizes writing clean, maintainable code with a focus on security from the ground up.
Documentation is provided for setting up the development environment, database, and running the application, along with a security policy detailing all configurations and practices.
Implementation Stages:
Environment Setup: Initializing Node.js project, installing dependencies, and setting up the PostgreSQL database.
Authentication System: Creating routes, controllers, and models for user registration and login, including security enhancements for password handling and token generation.
Security Configurations: Implementing HTTPS, input validation, and integrating security tools for regular assessments.
